<p>Table Initiative is a variant on Group Initiative.</p>

<p>Start with DM and players rolling Initiative. If at least half the players beat the DM's roll (using the highest NPC initiative), the players will go first, otherwise the DM/monsters go first. This is the <strong>Initiative Contest</strong>.</p>

<p>Play always starts at the player to the left of the DM, or with DM, depending on who wins the Initiative Contest. Play always proceeds clockwise through the seated order. This is the <strong>Table Order</strong>.</p>

<p>If a player rolls a natural 20, or scores a 20 or above on their initiative, then that player will get a chance to move and use a bonus action before combat starts, which is called a <strong>Reflex Round</strong>. Players with a negative initiative score may still get a Reflex Round on a natural 20.</p>

<p>If any of the NPCs have sufficient initiative scores that the DM's roll plus their score is above 20, they have a Reflex Round.</p>

<p>Before combat starts, all players and NPCs with a reflex round may move and take a bonus action. The Reflex Round happens using Table Order.</p>

<p>After the Reflex Round, combat proceeds normally using Table Order.</p>

<p>Leonus (+9 Initiative), Krogan (-1), and Raegar (+1, advantage) encounter a group of 3 Spined Devils (+2) and a Shadow Demon (+3).</p>

<p>DM: "Roll Initiative!"<br>
[DM rolls 14, using the Shadow Demon's score, for a total of 17].<br>
Leonus: "I rolled 26."<br>
Krogan: "I rolled a natural 20."<br>
Raegar: "I rolled a 4."<br>
DM: "With advantage?"<br>
Raegar: "... yes."<br>
DM: "Okay, players go first. Leonus and Krogan get a reflex round."<br>
[Leonus and Krogan may move and take one bonus action.]<br>
Leonus: "I move 30 feet back and Hide."<br>
Krogan: "I cast Shield of Faith on myself."</p>

<p>After the Reflex Round, the first combat round begins starting with the player seated left of the DM, since the players won the Initiative Contest, and continues clockwise until combat is finished.</p>

<p>I think this strikes a balance between Group Initiative, which makes feats like Alert much, much less useful, and Individual Initiative, which makes it hard to remember whose turn comes up next, or occasionally, whether everyone has had their turn.</p>

<p>The Table Order means that you know your turn is coming up soon when the player(s) to your right are acting, which gives you a chance to consider your tactics, actions, and look up any ability or spells which you may want clarification on before you use them.</p>

<p>The Reflex Round means that players with very high initiative scores or very good rolls will still gain a tactical advantage as they would using individual initiative, but not as completely as if it were a surprise round.</p>

<p>
The Initiative Contest might not be the best way to determine whether NPCs or Players get to go first, but I was trying to find a way that doesn't involve rolling a shit ton of dice and counting up scores to find out.
